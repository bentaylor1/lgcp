\title{exceedProbsAggregated function}
\usage{
exceedProbsAggregated(threshold, lg = NULL, lastonly = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{vector of threshold levels for the indicator function}

\item{lg}{an object of class aggregatedPredict}

\item{lastonly}{logical, whether to only compute the exceedances for the last time point. default is TRUE}
}
\value{
a function of Y that computes the indicator function I(exp(Y)>threshold) evaluated for each cell of a matrix Y, but with values aggregated to regions
If several tresholds are specified an array is returned with the [,,i]th slice equal to I(exp(Y)>threshold[i])
}
\description{
NOTE THIS FUNCTION IS IN TESTING AT PRESENT
}
\details{
This function computes regional exceedance probabilities after MCMC has finished, it requires the information to have been dumped to disk, and
to have been computed using the function lgcpPredictAggregated
\deqn{P[\exp(Y_{t_1:t_2})>k],}{P[\exp(Y_{t_1:t_2})>k],}
that is the probability that the relative risk exceeds threshold \eqn{k}{k}. Note that it is possible
to pass vectors of tresholds to the function, and the exceedance probabilities will be computed for each
of these.
