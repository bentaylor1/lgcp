\usage{
dump2dir(dirname, lastonly = TRUE, forceSave = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirname}{character vector of length 1 containing the name of the directory to create}

\item{lastonly}{only save output from time T? (see ?lgcpPredict for definition of T)}

\item{forceSave}{option to override display of menu}
}
\value{
object of class dump2dir
}
\description{
This function, when set by the \code{gridfunction} argument of \link{setoutput}, in turn called by the argument
\code{output.control} of \code{lgcpPredict} facilitates the dumping of data to disk. Data is dumped to a
netCDF file, \code{simout.nc}, stored in the directory specified by the user. If the directory does not exist,
then it will be created. Since the requested data dumped to disk may be very large in a run of \code{lgcpPredict},
by default, the user is prompted as to whether to proceed with prediction, this can be turned off by setting
the option \code{forceSave=TRUE} detailed here. To save space, or increase the number of simulations that can be
stored for a fixed disk space the option to only save the last time point is also available (\code{lastonly=TRUE},
which is the default setting).
