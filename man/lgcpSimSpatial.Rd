\usage{
lgcpSimSpatial(owin = NULL, spatial.intensity = NULL,
  expectednumcases = 100, cellwidth = 0.05,
  model.parameters = lgcppars(sigma = 2, phi = 0.2),
  spatial.covmodel = "exponential", covpars = c(), ext = 2,
  plot = FALSE, inclusion = "touching")
}
\arguments{
\item{owin}{observation window}

\item{spatial.intensity}{an object that can be coerced to one of class spatialAtRisk}

\item{expectednumcases}{the expected number of cases}

\item{cellwidth}{width of cells in same units as observation window}

\item{model.parameters}{parameters of model, see ?lgcppars. Only set sigma and phi for spatial model.}

\item{spatial.covmodel}{spatial covariance function, default is exponential, see ?CovarianceFct}

\item{covpars}{vector of additional parameters for spatial covariance function, in order they appear in chosen model in ?CovarianceFct}

\item{ext}{how much to extend the parameter space by. Default is 2.}

\item{plot}{logical, whether to plot the latent field.}

\item{inclusion}{criterion for cells being included into observation window. Either 'touching' or 'centroid'. The former includes all cells that touch the observation window, the latter includes all cells whose centroids are inside the observation window.}
}
\value{
