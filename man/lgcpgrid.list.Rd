\usage{
\method{lgcpgrid}{list}(grid, xvals = 1:dim(grid[[1]])[1],
  yvals = 1:dim(grid[[1]])[2], zvals = 1:length(grid), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{a list object with each member of the list being a numeric matrix, each matrix having the same dimension}

\item{xvals}{optional vector of x-coordinates associated to grid. By default, this is the cell index in the x direction.}

\item{yvals}{optional vector of y-coordinates associated to grid. By default, this is the cell index in the y direction.}

\item{zvals}{optional vector of z-coordinates (time) associated to grid. By default, this is the cell index in the z direction.}

\item{...}{other arguments}
}
\value{
an object of class lgcpgrid
}
\description{
Creates an lgcpgrid object from a list object plus some optional coordinates. Note that each element of the list should be a matrix,
and that each matrix should have the same dimension.
