\title{lgcpForecast function}
\usage{
lgcpForecast(lg, ptimes, spatial.intensity, temporal.intensity,
  inclusion = "touching")
}
\arguments{
\item{lg}{an object of class lgcpPredict}

\item{ptimes}{vector of time points for prediction. Must start strictly after last inferred time point.}

\item{spatial.intensity}{the fixed spatial component: an object of that can be coerced to one of class spatialAtRisk}

\item{temporal.intensity}{the fixed temporal component: either a numeric vector, or a function that can be coerced into an object of class temporalAtRisk}

\item{inclusion}{criterion for cells being included into observation window. Either 'touching' or 'centroid'. The former includes all cells that touch the observation window, the latter includes all cells whose centroids are inside the observation window.}
}
\value{
forcasted relative risk, Poisson intensities and Y values over grid, together with approximate variance.
}
\description{
Function to produce forecasts for the mean field \eqn{Y}{Y} at times beyond the last time point in the
analysis (given by the argument \code{T} in the function \code{lgcpPredict}).
