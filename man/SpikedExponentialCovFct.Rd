\title{SpikedExponentialCovFct function}
\usage{
SpikedExponentialCovFct(d, CovParameters, spikevar = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{toral distance}

\item{CovParameters}{parameters of the latent field, an object of class "CovParamaters".}

\item{spikevar}{the additional variance at distance 0}
}
\value{
the spiked exponential covariance function; note that the spikevariance is currently not estimated as part of the MCMC routine, and is thus treated as a fixed parameter.
}
\description{
A function to declare and also evaluate a spiked exponential covariance function. Note that the present version of
lgcp only offers estimation for sigma and phi, the additional parameter 'spikevar' is treated as fixed.
