\title{exceedProbs function}
\usage{
exceedProbs(threshold, direction = "upper")
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{vector of threshold levels for the indicator function}

\item{direction}{default 'upper' giving exceedance probabilities, alternative is 'lower', which gives 'subordinate probabilities'}
}
\value{
a function of Y that computes the indicator function I(exp(Y)>threshold) evaluated for each cell of a matrix Y
If several tresholds are specified an array is returned with the [,,i]th slice equal to I(exp(Y)>threshold[i])
}
\description{
This function can be called using \code{MonteCarloAverage} (see \code{fun3} the examples in the help file for
\link{MonteCarloAverage}). It computes exceedance probabilities,
\deqn{P[\exp(Y_{t_1:t_2})>k],}{P[\exp(Y_{t_1:t_2})>k],}
that is the probability that the relative reisk exceeds threshold \eqn{k}{k}. Note that it is possible
to pass vectors of tresholds to the function, and the exceedance probabilities will be computed for each
of these.
