\description{
Generic function used in the construction of space-time planar point patterns. An stppp object is like a ppp object,
but with extra components for (1) a vector giving the time at whcih the event occurred and (2) a time-window over which observations occurred.
Observations are assumed to occur in the plane and the observation window is assumed not to change over time.
